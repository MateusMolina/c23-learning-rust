# Learning rust

## Learning Resources

- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html)
- [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html)
- [No Boilerplate YT Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifaLk5v3W90&list=PLZaoyhMXgBzoM9bfb5pyUOT3zjnaDdSEP&index=8)
- [Rust official docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/)
- Let's Get Rusty, Youtube Channel. A coworker recommended it to me.

## Methodology

Learning goals and activities will be managed as issues. Resources and projects/exercises will be added to this repo.

I'll follow first Rust by Example and using the book, when I don't get something. I'm also considering to use ChatGPT to help me out debugging, but I was told the compiler generates quite good logs. So maybe it won't be so necessary.
